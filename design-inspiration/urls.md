# Design Inspiration URLs

## Layouts

- URLs: https://storybook.js.org/,
        https://stripe.com/
  Name: Storybook landing page, 
        Stripe landing page
  I like:
    - The way the elements on the left-hand side of the screen, the text elements, stay in place and stay centered during certain parts of scrolling while the right-hand side zooms or adjusts. It's a really nice and attractive feature. 
    - The spacing and readability is also quite nice and clean. 
    - The Stripe page in particular combines nice large cards which are attractive as well. 
  I want to take:
    - The ability to have elements on one side of the page stay in place during scroll while some other element on the page changes or scrolls, with both then moving at a certain point in the scrolling process.
    - Readability and spacing of the text and image or card elements.

- URL: https://https://design.gitlab.com/
  Name: Pajamas design system by GitLab landing page
  I like:
    - The clean gradient starting all the way from white down into a mix of different colors below in the main image. It's very elegant to have changes in the Y and X directions for the gradients moving between different colors. 
    - The well-organized sidebar with all of the major elements I would want to hit, located and openable so that a user of a system can access easily different parts of the app and quickly drill down into more specific tasks. 
  I want to take:
    - The ability to have the gradient changes in X and Y directions and moving between different colors and elements. 
    - The general sidebar design and functionality, including search. 

- URL: https://nordhealth.design/
  Name: Nordhealth design system landing page
  I like:
    - The way the page uses various shades of the same base color for different elements. In this case, it's blue with a shadings from light blue to darker blue for various purposes. I would not want to select the same color for my design system, but I would want to use a similar concept of using various shades of the same color for different elements.

    - The ability to easilyuse various shades of the same color for different elements.

- URL: https://preview.tabler.io/layout-fluid-vertical.html
  Name: Tabler layout fluid vertical
  I like:
    - The chart cards that show up at the top, near the very top as well, and the graphs such as development activity, and the relatively dense but clean table that shows up at the bottom under invoices, complete with links to actions and so forth. 
  I want to take:
    - The table layout, use of colors, actions, and so forth that stays crisp and clean with charts on top, though ours will be much more heavily focused on the table and will have a minimum of charts to avoid distraction.

  I like:
    - The beautiful, smooth chart. Just gorgeous with nice use of color and overlapping colors, dashed versus solid lines. Really, really pretty. The cards above are also really attractive and simple while still conveying some information. 
  I want to take:
    - The chart design and use of color.

  Name: Shopify metaobjects page
  I like:
    - The clean and simple design of the table with other information summarizing above. This is a really nice layout overall, though I'm not particularly happy with the specifics. The layout of a dense table underneath, summary cards above, and an extensible sidebar is attractive.
